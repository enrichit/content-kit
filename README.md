# Content Kit

> A modular content managment editor.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
Continuation of content-kit-experiments as a Vue app using single file components.

## Todo

* Reduce redundency in imports between `content-kit` and `ck-list-input`/`ck-list-render`. Should only have to register dependencies once.
* Add unit tests for existing components.
